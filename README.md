# Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting

This repository contains a demand forecasting project aimed at optimizing inventory management using historical sales data. The developed model will help businesses maintain appropriate inventory levels, minimize stockouts and overstock situations, and enhance the overall efficiency of their supply chains.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze historical sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and seasonal variations
- Develop and compare different time series and machine learning models for demand forecasting
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics, such as MAE, MSE, and MAPE
- Utilize demand forecasts to optimize inventory management strategies, including safety stock levels, reorder points, and order quantities
- Document the methodology, findings, and recommendations for future improvements

## Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, if using deep learning models)

## Dataset

This project relies on the "Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset features historical sales data for 50 different items across ten stores. Access the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data
